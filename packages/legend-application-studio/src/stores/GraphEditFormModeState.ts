   * NOTE: IMPORTANT! This method is both a savior and a sinner. It helps reprocessing the graph state to use a new graph
   * built from the new model context data, it resets the graph properly. The bane here is that resetting the graph properly is
   * not trivial, for example, in the cleanup phase, there are things we want to re-use, such as the one-time processed system
   * metamodels or the `reusable` metamodels from project dependencies. There are also explorer states like the package tree,
   * opened tabs, change detection, etc. to take care of. There are a lot of potential pitfalls. For these, we will add the
   * marker:
   *
   * @risk memory-leak
   *
   * to indicate we should check carefully these pieces when we detect memory issue as it might still
   * be referring to the old graph
   *
   * In the past, we have found that there are a few potential root causes for memory leak:
   * 1. State management Mobx allows references, as such, it is sometimes hard to trace down which references can cause problem
   *    We have to understand that the behind this updater is very simple (replace), yet to do it cleanly is not easy, since
   *    so far it is tempting to refer to elements in the graph from various editor state. On top of that, change detection
   *    sometimes obfuscate the investigation but we have cleared it out with explicit disposing of reaction
   * 2. Reusable models, at this point in time, we haven't completed stabilize the logic for handling generated models, as well
   *    as dependencies, we intended to save computation time by reusing these while updating the graph. This can pose potential
   *    danger as well. Beware the way when we start to make system/project dependencies references elements of current graph
   *    e.g. when we have a computed value in a immutable class that get all subclasses, etc.
   * 3. We reprocess editor states to ensure good UX, e.g. find tabs to keep open, find tree nodes to expand, etc.
   *    after updating the graph. These in our experience is the **MOST COMMON** source of memory leak. It is actually
   *    quite predictable since structures like tabs and tree node embeds graph data, which are references to the old graph
   *
   * NOTE: One big obfuscating factor is overlapping graph refresh. Sometimes, we observed that calling this update graph
   * method multiple times can throws Mobx off and causes reusing change detection state to cause memory-leak. As such,
   * we have blocked the possibility of calling compilation/graph-update/generation simultaneously
   *
   * A note on how to debug memory-leak issue:
   * 1. Open browser Memory monitor
   * 2. Go to text mode and compile multiple times (triggering graph update)
   * 3. Try to force garbage collection, if we see memory goes up after while, it's pretty clear that this is memory-leak
   * (note that since we disallow stacking multiple compilation and graph update, we have simplify the detection a lot)
   * See https://auth0.com/blog/four-types-of-leaks-in-your-javascript-code-and-how-to-get-rid-of-them/
