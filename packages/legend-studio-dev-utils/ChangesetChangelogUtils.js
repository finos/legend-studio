/**
 * Customize the changelog generator to not show changelog entry without content.
 *
 * Since we might enforce contributors to provide a changeset to at least bump a `patch` for any
 * packages they modify, there are times when it doesn't really make sense to require
 * a changeset summary. As such, we need a way to filter those changesets without summary out from
 * the changelog.
 *
 * NOTE: We try not to customize too far from the default changelog generator `@changesets/changelog-github`.
