 * Make sure the changeset covers all the packages whose files are changed since the specified reference.
 * This is good to check changesets in a PR to ensure that the contributors have at least did a `patch`
 * bump for all the changes they made.
 *
 * This is different from the philosophy of the creator of `changesets` where the reviewers and the contributors
 * make `human` decision about the changes and that we can `trust` this decision. The problem with this
 * approach is that sometimes, both the reviewers and the contributors can miss out on the changeset.
 * And a package which is supposed to be released was not released! - This is really bad.
 *
 * By using this check, for whatever changes made, at least a `patch` bump is required. This covers the base
 * for any PR.
