/**
 * Previously, these exports rely on ES module interop to expose `default` export
 * properly. But since we use `ESM` for Typescript resolution now, we lose this
 * so we have to workaround by importing these and re-export them from CJS
 *
 * TODO: remove these when the package properly work with Typescript's nodenext
 * module resolution
 *
 * @workaround ESM
 * See https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/49298
 *
 * In addition to that, due to our upgrade to Typescript 5.0, we are forced to enable
 * --verbatimModuleSyntax flag, so we have to use CommonJS syntax in this file
 * See https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0/#verbatimmodulesyntax
