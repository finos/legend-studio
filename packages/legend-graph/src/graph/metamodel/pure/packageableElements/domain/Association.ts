/**
 * Assocation needs exactly 2 properties (for 2 classes, not enumeration, not primitive), e.g.
 *    employees: Person[*]
 *    firm: Firm[1]
 * -> inside of Person, we will see a property firm: Firm[1] and vice versa
 *
 * NOTE: This is a very important note on the usage of `Association`. Association allows a very
 * nice trick that is without modifying some classes that you don't own, you can `create` property
 * on them by using association, but this can also be misused and accidentally create tangled cycles
 * of dependency between project. Imagine we create association between classes in project and system
 * or project dependencies. As such, in the app, we have to make it very clear that we prohibits this.
 *
 * TODO: We probably should change backend to do compilation check whether association refers
 * to a class from a different projects. Here, while building the graph, we can make use of the
 * root package to verify this in the UI and make this a validation error in a way.
 * See https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/issues/282
