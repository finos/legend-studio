/**
 * NOTE: despite the push to adopt visitor pattern across the code-base, hashing implementation for now will remain within
 * the owner class instead of being moved to an outside visitor for the following reasons:
 * 1. Hashing of sub-structures should be cached (using mobx @computed) and hence we would have to do something like:
 *    @computed get hashCode(): string { return this.accept(new HashVisitor()) }
 *    @computed get hashCode(): string { return hashSubElement(this) } // for sub-structures without an `accept` method
 * 2. On the other hand, we cannot remove `get hashCode` from sub-structure such as `Tag` or `Stereotype` because we want
 *    to cache these, regardless of how we compute hash for bigger structure like `Class` or `Enumeration`.
 *    The whole point of the visitor pattern is to avoid the exploring sub-structures in a structure, i.e. we should only
 *    care about the `hashCode` of a class or an enumeration and trickle down those structure in the visitor; and we can do
 *    that, but then we would still need to call `hashCode` for each sub-structure to make use of the cache instead of
 *    recompute them on the spot.
 * 3. A huge benefit of visitor pattern is to collocate the hashing logic in one place to reduce look-up time, but if we
 *    use `.hashCode` for sub-structures, visitor pattern will actually mean more look-ups.
 * 4. Also because of caching, certain really simple sub-structure would seem overkill to have hashing logic in a visitor:
 *    class AbstractSomething {
 *      @computed get hashCode(): string { return hashArray(['abstract-something', ...<and some other simple things>... ]) }
 *    }
 * 5. It's not too bad to have hashing logic coupled with the structure it's trying to hash
 *    (e.g. `hashCode` and `equals` in Java)

/**
 * This method can be used to debug hashing.
 *
 * We have tried to come up with a more robust way to debug hash, such as to construct the hash tree, but that's not
 * quite feasible for the following reasons:
 * 1. Since sometimes there are properties we don't drill down like for a class, we just take the path, we don't have
 *    a systematic way to construct the hash tree, so we have to rely on the implementation of the hashCode function
 *    in each element, which defeats the purpose of having a generic approach for debugging hash
 * 2. If we ignore the implementation detail of `get hashCode` and expand the property if it has `hashCode` then we
 *    might risk getting into an infinite loop
 * 3. The manual way to come up with the `get hashCode` is in order to reconcile the differences between metamodels and
 *    protocol models. If we only compare metamodels to protocol models for example, the problem might be less complicated,
 *    but we're dealing with 2 hash systems (in a way)
 * 4. As such, the best solution at the moment is to come up with a function like this
 *    to debug hash where we can put it at a top level structure like `Mapping` and then choose which part of the hash
 *    we would like to `explore`
 *
 * @param typesToExpand when we trickle down the object properties, we want to drill down so we want to choose
 *                      the property to drill down (by its type) since sometimes we don't need to compute the
 *                      actual hash code for the property (for example: a class, or an enumeration) while computing
 *                      the hash, just their path.
