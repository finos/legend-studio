Add basic support for a light-themed mode for query editor. This will be available only to standalone mode (i.e. `Legend Query`) instead of embedded query builder since we want the embedded builder to have consistent look and field with the host app ([#1374](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/issues/1374)).
