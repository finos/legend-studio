'@finos/legend-studio-preset-query-builder': patch
---

Support `compilation` in form mode, user now can click the hammer icon on the status bar or use the hotkey `F9` to run compilation on the current query. This is particularly helpful when user works with `derivation` (see https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/issues/254).
