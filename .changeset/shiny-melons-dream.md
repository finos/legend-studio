'@finos/legend-studio': patch

Rework how zooming works in diagram editor. Now, upon scrolling, zoom will use the pointer location as the zoom center rather than using the canvas center. Also, we allow user to be able to choose the zoom level or do a zoom to fit. Also, we now disallow negative zoom level and cap at the minimum level of 5%.
