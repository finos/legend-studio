'@finos/legend-studio-preset-query-builder': patch
---

Add support for aggregation in projection mode using `groupBy()`: user now can use aggregate operators like `count()`, `distinct()`, `sum()`, `average()`, `min()`, `max()`, `stdDev()`, etc.. See https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/issues/253 for more details.
