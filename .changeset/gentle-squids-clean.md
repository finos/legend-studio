Add extension mechanism to allow providing suggestion in forms of keywords/snippets when working in `text-mode` when user create a new element. For example, when users type `#` we would start by showing `###Pure`, `###Mapping`, etc., when we're within `###Pure` section, contextual suggestions should start showing when users try to create new `class`, `enumeration`, etc.
