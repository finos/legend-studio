**BREAKING CHANGE:** Updated props for `CodeEditor` component: Changed `showMiniMap` to `hideMinimap`; added `lightTheme` option which can temporarily be specified to customize the theme used in light mode; also defaulted to show padding around code editor and added option `hidePadding` to disable this behavior.
