'@finos/legend-studio-plugin-query-builder': patch
---

Rework graph-fetch tree editor: instead of showing the full tree and allow picking the properties using radio buttons, we let users drag-and-drop the properties from the explorer tree. This makes the behavior more in-synced with projection. See https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/issues/204 for more details.
