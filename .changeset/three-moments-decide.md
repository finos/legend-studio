Created diff view tables for regular non-JSON objects and added "accept" button functionality to update expected test results with actual function output.

This change enhances the testing workflow by:

- Displaying visual diff tables for non-JSON object comparisons
- Providing an "accept" button to quickly update expected results
- Streamlining the process of updating test expectations when function behavior changes
