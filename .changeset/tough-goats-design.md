Improve diagram editor modelling capabilities (related to https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/issues/300). In diagram editor, users now have can see all supported hotkeys and have the tools to create new classes, properties, inheritance relationships, etc. All of this is made possible thanks to @pierredebelen for contributing to the core diagram renderer in https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/338.
