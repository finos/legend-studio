'@finos/legend-studio': patch
---

Made several improvements to diagram editor:

- Add a separate mode for pan/zoom
- Create new basic property hotkey is not `Alt + DownArrow`
- Fix a bug where diagram editor hotkeys not being picked up if the user hasn't clicked on the diagram editor
- Rework class view selection behavior: single clicking a class will no-longer show classview editor; double-clicking is required instead.
