/**
 * Prettier is an __opinionated__ way to format code.
 * As they put it `By far the biggest reason for adopting Prettier is to stop all the ongoing debates over styles.`
 * To comply with this spirit, we did 2 things:
 *  1. Limit customization we do to Prettier config.
 *  2. Set lint rules that comply with Prettier rule set and option philosophy.
 *
 * See https://prettier.io/docs/en/why-prettier.html
 * See https://prettier.io/docs/en/option-philosophy.html
 *
 * Not everyone likes Prettier, and one of the hardest thing to get used to when migrating to Prettier
 * is the `print-width` option. As mentioned before, we use the `default`. However, we understand that
 * there are places that where `Prettier` line-breaking behavior might actually make the code less clear.
 * For example when we want a series of one-liner function which should be grouped together:
 *
 * ```
 *  func1() { if (...) { doSomething1() } else { doOtherwise1() } }
 *  func2() { if (...) { doSomething2() } else { doOtherwise2() } }
 *  func3() { if (...) { doSomething3() } else { doOtherwise3() } }
 *  func4() { if (...) { doSomething4() } else { doOtherwise4() } }
 * ```
 *
 * For these cases, we can use `ignore` syntax for Prettier
 * See https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#print-width
 *
 * NOTE: the biggest limitation of prettier so far is that it does not have a mature `ignore` support.
 * We are waiting for `prettier-ignore-start/end` syntax to be supported.
 * See https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/5287
