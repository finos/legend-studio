        Please provide the **minimal** `Pure code` or `models' JSON` necessary to reproduce the bug.
        **Tip:** In Studio, use `text-mode (F8)` to obtain models' Pure code, and `model importer (F2)` to obtain models' JSON.
        If a single file is not sufficient, providing a `repository link`, or attaching an `archive` will do just fine.
