/**
 * Changesets generate tags and Github release by default, but this is cluttering the

 * As such, we would want to undo all of these and create a single release.
 *
 * Following is the list of expected environment variables:
 *
 * GITHUB_TOKEN - the Github token
 * PUBLISH_PACKAGES - the list of published packages (with name and version) output by `changesets/action`
 * MAIN_PACKAGE - the name of the package within the list of published packages. If this is available,
 *                a new version tag and its release will be published to Github.
