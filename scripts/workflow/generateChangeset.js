/**
 * NOTE: when we generate changeset, we want to use `master` branch as the reference point
 * unlike `origin/master` which is used in the pipeline to check for validity of the PR changesets.
 * There are 2 reasons for this:
 *
 * 1. The Github actions does not know about the local `master` branch, it has to use `origin/master`
 *    to compute the changeset
 * 2. For the suggested workflow where the user does not commit directly on his/her `master` branch
 *    but work on another local feature branch, their branch often stems from `master` instead of
 *    `origin/master`, so it makes more sense to compute changeset since `master`. Also, using `master`
 *    in this case will likely produce a more compact and accurate changeset.
 *
 * As such, before generating changeset, we should warn user if they are working on `master` branch or
 * their `master` and `origin/master` mismatch.
 *
 * Of course, we can allow a workaround for people who work directly `master` branch.
